# SilksongAccess-Dev
Development of the Hollow Knight: Silksong BVI accessibility mod

# How to test/install, Updated 12/4/2025
## Must have any version of Hollow Knight Silksong installed
- Download and extract the `Silksong Access.zip` file from this message
- Open the folder and copy the contents, being `winhttp.dll`, `BepInEx folder`, `.doorstop_config`, and `doorstop_config.ini`
- Find your Hollow Knight Silksong installation directory from Steam or wherever else you have it installed, usually `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Hollow Knight Silksong`
- Paste the contents in the root of your Silksong install folder, next to the `Hollow Knight Silksong.exe`.
- Open the game! This mod uses Tolk, so SAPI and NVDA should work fine but speech will not natively work unless a screen reader is open.
